        <p>I had the privilege of visiting the U.K. on two ocasions: in 2018 and 2021. These are some of the highlights
            from my time there</p>

                alt="Me standing in font of Loch Tay"> Deep in the heart of Scotland, <strong>Loch Tay</strong> is a
            serene retreat surrounded by rolling hills, ancient history, and the charm of the Scottish Highlands. It’s a
            place where nature’s stillness invites you to slow down and soak in the magic of the landscape.
        </p>


        <p> Loch Tay is one of Scotland's largest lochs, stretching over <em>14 miles</em>. The shimmering waters,
            flanked by the towering Ben Lawers mountain range, create a postcard-perfect view at every turn. Whether

        <h2>Why I loved the U.K.</h2>
        <p>
            The United Kingdom is a place that feels like stepping into a storybook while being surrounded by modern
            charm. It’s a country where every visit leaves you with unforgettable memories. All the different places I
            visited each had their own unique charm and I would love to go back in the the future (especially for the
            soccer matches).
